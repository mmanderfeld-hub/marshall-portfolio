<h1>Removable Arm Assembly for 45 Ton Brake Press</h1>

<p><strong>Role:</strong> Mechanical Engineering Intern</p>
<p><strong>Company:</strong> Wilson Trailer Company</p>
<p><strong>Term:</strong> Summer 2025</p>

<p><em>
Design details have been limited to respect company confidentiality.
</em></p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Designed and implemented a removable arm assembly for a 45-ton brake press
to improve tooling access, maintain efficiency, and operator safety. Collaborated
with the lead manufacturing engineer and machine operators to balance structural
requirements with usability needs. Integrated a foldable support leg for stability
and compact storage. Also utilized nylon ball transfers to prevent surface damage
while enabling multi-axis material positioning.
    
</p>


<h2>Technical Contributions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Mechanical design and prototyping</li>
    <li>3D modeling and fit-up verification</li>
    <li>Manufacturing support</li>
    <li>Assembly and testing</li>
</ul>


<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>
Balancing structural rigidity and removability while integrating into existing brake press geometry.
The assembly required added support for stability, but the support system also had to fold or detach
for storage. Additional constraints included preventing material surface damage and maintaining
operator-friendly ergonomics.
</p>


<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<p>
Strengthened my ability to design within real-world manufacturing constraints, while translating
operator and engineer feedback into practical mechanical solutions. Gained experience designing for
servicability, ergonomics, and structural stability in an industrial environment.
